Attendance System Using Face Recognition is a Python-based project that utilizes computer vision techniques to automate the process of taking attendance. The system uses a webcam or a camera to capture images of individuals, extracts their facial features, and compares them with a pre-stored database to identify and mark the presence of individuals.

The project is built using Python and the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks. The facial recognition is done using the dlib library, which uses a pre-trained face detection model to identify faces in the images. The system also uses various data structures like dictionaries and lists to store and maintain attendance records.

The project has a user-friendly interface, allowing users to add new students or employees, view attendance reports, and export data to CSV files. The system generates daily, weekly, and monthly reports, which can be used by educational institutes or businesses to track attendance.

The GitHub repository for the project includes all the source code, datasets, and documentation required to run the project. The documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and use the system. The repository is well-organized and has clear and concise documentation to help users understand the code and its functionality.
